# GAN-Generative-Adeversial-Network-on-MNIST-Generation
Though the network is a success, however, 'Gradient Vanishing' problem occur multiple times while I trained the network. It seems to require WGAN or other GAN architecture to solve this problem, hopefully in the near future I'd finish this project by tackle with this problem.
